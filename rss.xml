            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>There's brew love in a new lager saga: Daniel Noah Sheikh reinvents beer.</h1><p>The crafting and consumption of artisanal ale has come to define hipsterdom as surely as unchecked facial hair and tattoos. Lager, once the fashionable brew, has been largely left out in the cold. One young MÃ¼nchner, though, is determined on rebuilding buzz around bold but bubbly Bavarian beer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a1b9867e100274b4a255e35f15b19fc71dc32385.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>eero: No More Internet Dead Zones</h1><p>Nearly all homes have a WiFi dead zone: you never get messages in the kitchen, you can't watch Netflix in the bedroom, you can't FaceTime in the backyard. This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brooklyn's Luft Coffee</h1><p>About five years ago, Blair Smith's twice-a-day coffee pitstop at NYC's Kaffe 1668 led to him striking up a friendship with barista Justin Rodriguez behind the counter. Smith then met mobile developer Aaron Sutula in a coffee seminar held by an espresso machine company. "I took a day off of work to go," remembers Sutula.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4cab8b5548c02525515410d6e85dd5580051ec9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
